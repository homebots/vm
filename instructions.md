# Concepts

- each instruction is 1-byte long
- each instruction can have zero or more operands
- two working areas in memory are available: slots and arguments
- arguments are int32 pointers
- slots are int values
- arguments point to location in the program memory, starting from zero
- slots hold to values, either passed to or assigned by operators
